# Holiday-Themed Family Website Project

A holiday-themed website for your family with at least three pages: a homepage, a gallery page, and a Christmas wish list form. The website should include a group picture and individual summaries about each family member. Additionally, showcase previous holiday engagements through a gallery page and implement a form for Christmas wish lists. Feel free to add any additional pages or content beyond the requirements.

## Usage

The point of the website is for others to learn about the Singh Family. The website showcases small summaries of each member, as well as a gallery. The gallery contains multiple pictures of past events and family moments. The color theme is yellow, red, and green. Red and green signifies the holidays and Christmas. Yellow is a good touch to the two colors and adds spice to the website. There is also a wish list form for members to input their gift ideas and what they want for Christmas. For the wish list form, once the user clicks submit, it takes them to a page to ensure the user that the form was successfully submitted. For the last feature, the navbar options change to the color yellow when the user hovers over them. All the pages have a footer with credits and quick links to other tabs.
